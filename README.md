## Introduction
Depth estimation is the task of predicting depth information from a single image. This notebook demonstrates how to use the MiDaS model to perform depth estimation on input images. MiDaS is known for its accuracy and robustness across a variety of scenes and conditions.

## Features
- Loading the MiDaS model
- Preprocessing input images
- Generating depth maps
- Visualizing depth estimation results

## Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Torch
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python torch matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saadtariq001s/depth-estimation-midas.git
cd depth-estimation-midas
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook depth_estimation.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the MiDaS model, preprocess your images, and generate depth maps.

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations of the input images and their corresponding depth maps. These visualizations help you understand the model's performance and the depth information it predicts.
